Its name derives from the narrow black band under its head which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it one of the most easily identified types of penguin. Other common names are 'ringed penguin', 'bearded penguin', and 'stonecracker penguin' due to its harsh call.\nChinstrap penguins have an average body length of 72 centimetres (28 in) and a weight of 3–5 kilograms (6.6–11.0 lb), however their weight can drop as low as 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) depending on the breeding cycle. Males are both larger and heavier than females.\n\nThe adult chinstraps' flippers are black with a white edge; the inner sides of the flippers are white. The face is white extending behind the eyes, which are reddish brown; the chin and throat are white as well, while the short bill is black. The strong legs and the webbed feet are pink. The chinstrap penguin's black-and-white plumage helps camouflage it in the water from predators such as seals. When seen from above, the bird's black back blends into the dark water below, while the bird's underside blends into the sunshine above when seen from below. \n\nLike most penguins, Chinstrap Penguins use their flippers to ‘fly’ at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour. On land, Chinstraps often ‘toboggan’ on their stomachs, propelling themselves by their feet and flippers. Chinstrap Penguins climb out of the water and up steep slopes using all four limbs and they are able to jump large distances to reach footholds. They communicate through ritual behaviours of head and flipper waving, calling, bowing, gesturing and preening. Stares, pointing and charging may occur when territorial disputes arise.","title":"Chinstrap Penguin","url":"http://cache3.asset-cache.net/xt/640345152.jpg?v=1&g=fs1|0|FKF|45|152&s=1&b=RjI4"},{"x":78,"y":53,"snippet":"The Adelie Penguin is common in the Antarctic region. The French explorer, Jules Dumont d’Urville, named them after his beloved wife, Adele.\n\nAdelie penguins are mid-sized most being between 18 and 30 inches in length, and weighing 8 to 13 pounds each.They have a distinctive white ring that encircles the eye and feathers at the base of the bill. These long feathers hide most of the red bill. The tail is a little longer than other penguins' tails. Their appearance is closest to the stereotypical image of penguins as mostly black with a white belly, looking somewhat like a tuxedo.\n\nAdélie penguins breed from October to February on shores around the Antarctic continent. Adélies build rough nests of stones; two eggs are laid, and incubated for 32 to 34 days by the parents taking turns (shifts typically last for 12 days). \nThey are highly social creatures, moving and remaining in groups. When they encounter other colonies, or species of penguins they are aggressive toward them. They are said to have a temperament similar to a human children, petulant and selfish.\nTaking from the species around them, they eat mostly krill, Antarctic silverfish, ice krill, Glacial Squid and Sea Krill. Over the centuries they have gone from eating fish to krill out of necessity and availability.\n\nThey may look cute, but don’t let them fool you. When they are confronted with other penguins or prey they have no problem becoming aggressive in nature. They are a social creature and also enjoy the monogamy of a relationship that keeps them forging forward and their species healthy throughout evolution.","title":"Adelie Penguin in Antarctica","url":"http://cache4.asset-cache.net/xt/640342248.jpg?v=1&g=fs1|0|FKF|42|248&s=1&b=RjI4"},{"x":79,"y":53,"snippet":"Although there are 35 species of seals, only six types live in Antarctica: Antarctic Fur Seals, Crabeater Seals, Leopard Seals, Ross Seals, and Weddell Seals. However, these six species make up the majority of the world's seal population. With no natural land predators, such as polar bears or man, Antarctic seals behave much differently than northern seals, showing little fear of man.\n\nSeals are categorized into three families: true seals, eared seals (common to most zoos), and walruses (found in the arctic). All of the seals in Antarctica are true seals (no ears). Even without ears, seal hearing out of the water is as good as human's. In the water, their hearing is even better. Its theorized that seals use a type of sonar to locate food, much like what dolphins and whales use.\n\nIn addition to using sonar for navigation and locating groups of food, its believed seals use their whiskers as a form of radar. The whiskers detect movement in the water and allow the seal to zoom in a particular object. Through the use of their sonar and radar, seals can actually find food in complete darkness better than in the light.\n\nAs for their eyes, seals don't really see color but they are particularly sensitive to common sea water colors (greens, green-blues). Seals eyes have a silvery lining behind the retina, just like cats and other nocturnal/low-light hunters. This lining reflects the light back through the eye and increases the total amount of light absorbed by the eye--another necessary feature when hunting in the dimly lit depths of the oceans.\n\nWhen in the water, a seal's nose closes automatically and doesn't reopen until it surface. Typically, a seal can remain underwater for 15 minutes (young) to 30 minutes (adults). This also is true of when they're sleep. Seals sleep just under the surface of the ocean and can resurface for air without waking.","title":"Seal Basking in Antarctic Sunshine","url":"http://cache1.asset-cache.net/xt/640347202.jpg?v=1&g=fs1|0|FKF|47|202&s=1&b=RjI4"},{"x":80,"y":53,"snippet":"Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse lies on Sea Wolves Island in the Beagle Channel, just outside the southernmost city of Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego.

Pillbug's eggs of 100-200 in number are carried in the ventral (underside) surface in the brood pouch (marsupium) and hatch after 3-4 weeks. The young may stay on the mother's pouch for additional 1-2 weeks.\nAdult pillbug's colors ranges from gray to brown. Size when mature is 8.5-18mm. It has one pair of antennae and has compound eyes. The body is made up of thorax (pereon) with 7 segments and 7 legs. It has ability to roll into a ball when disturbed making it look like a pill hence called Pillbug. They can live 2-5 years.\nAlthough studies show that pillbugs' foraging has positive effect on the ecosystem, they are sometimes considered pests when they wander indoors. Generally harmless, they are sometimes kept as pets among children in some areas throughout the USA.

Large bull seals are the first to arrive at the reserve in late October or early November where they will wait for females. The cow's arrive later and are herded into harems by the bulls, where they give birth to a single pup which is covered in white fur. The seals return to the North Sea in January before returning to the same area to give birth the following year. The Donna Nook reserve is the UK's premier destination to see Grey Seals and thousands of visitors from across the country come to see the wildlife spectacle every year.

Possibly, this sculpture was used to give the Hostal de la Lleona it's name. This hostel was functioning during the Middle Ages and continued right up to modern times. It was situated in a good place, at the entrance to the city and all the travellers who were coming to Girona from France stopped there.\nDespite the fact that the sculpture represents a male lion, it was first confused with a monkey, because it was climbing, and later on it became part of Girona’s mythology as a lioness. As the figure was not very high up, people standing on tiptoe, stretching up their arms, they could just reach and touch the small beast’s bottom with their hands. And since the Catalans are rather destiny fearing in their ways, the act became a ritual.\nThe lioness became quite famous among both Girona people and visitors. In time, the rite of touching or even kissing its bottom became a sort of baptism for newcomers to Girona, after having signed the city register. And, for those of Girona, a guarantee of a happy return to their city, after having been away.
